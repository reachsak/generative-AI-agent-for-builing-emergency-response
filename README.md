## Summary
<img src="/images/emerge.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; max-width: 200px;">

This study explores the use of a multimodal large language model (VLLM) as an autonomous agent designed for disaster detection and emergency response in smart buildings. While the framework is designed for general emergency situations, the primary focus is on fire emergencies.

## Detection

- **Continuous Monitoring**: The Vision AI agent continuously analyzes video feeds from various security cameras and sensors within the building.
- **Emergency Recognition**: Upon detecting visual cues such as smoke, flames, or heat signatures, the VLLM recognizes the situation as a potential fire incident.
- **Cross-Referencing Data**: The Vision AI agent cross-references visual data with inputs from other sensors (e.g., smoke detectors, heat sensors) to confirm and pinpoint the fire's origin and extent.

## Response

- **Alerting and Notification**: 
  - The Vision AI agent generates and broadcasts audible and visual alerts, notifying occupants of the emergency and its specific location.
  - Automated notifications are sent to emergency services (e.g., fire department, ambulance) with detailed incident information, including location, severity, and detected hazards.
  - Personalized notifications are sent to designated response teams, building managers, and relevant personnel, providing real-time updates and instructions.

- **Real-Time Information for Emergency Responders**:
  - Visual and textual updates are provided to emergency responders, enabling remote assessment and planning of response strategies.
  - Detailed reports and recommendations, such as fire location, intensity, and potential hazards, are generated for firefighters.

- **Smart Building System Coordination**: 
  - The Vision AI agent coordinates with other systems, such as access control and ventilation, to support emergency response efforts (e.g., unlocking doors, controlling smoke extraction).

## Evacuation Guidance

- **Route Analysis**: Based on fire location and spread, the VLLM identifies the safest evacuation routes for different areas within the building.
- **Contextual Understanding with RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) ingests building information models, enabling the AI to understand the building’s layout and provide appropriate evacuation routes based on the fire’s location.

## Advantages of Local and Open-Source LLMs

- **Privacy and Speed**: Local, open-source LLMs enhance inference speed and address data privacy concerns, as data remains within the system, contrasting commercial AI models like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT.

## Benefits of Using a Multimodal LLM Over Conventional Methods

Unlike conventional deep learning or computer vision frameworks, the multimodal LLM agent offers:

- **Contextual Understanding and Reasoning**: The VLLM can interpret complex, context-based information and apply it to dynamic emergency scenarios.
- **Natural Language Communication**: The agent provides natural language explanations and instructions, improving interactions with emergency responders and building occupants.
